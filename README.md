Library designed to allow for embedding static content generated by building rust wasm code in native rust workspaces. This allows for projects with some properties that I think are neat:

- wasm and native code in the same workspace, sharing common code including types
- embedding wasm build output in native binaries, allowing for apps serving dynamic frontends - for example, a process info visualizer that renders process info using SVG and uses onclick handlers to provide for rich interactivity

Example project with a rust webserver (warp) serving a rust frontend (yew) as wasm can be found here: TODO link

currently requires latest rust nightly or higher (due to bug fix for a stable regression, not for experimental features)

TODO:
- support wasm build methods other than cargo-web (doesn't seem to be under active development)
- FIXED: use phf instead of lazy_static after https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70584 is resolved 
- mark as non-nightly only when the fix to that issue hits stable
